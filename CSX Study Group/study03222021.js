/*
Write a function which accepts two arrays and a number. 
If any element in the second array is greater than a number, add 10 to every element 
in the first array. Return the first passed in array.
*/



/*
Create a function 'addEvenNumbers' that takes a number as an argument. 'addEvenNumbers' 
should add up all the even numbers from 2 to the number you passed to the function.
For example, if the input is 8 then your function should return 20 because 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20.
*/



/*
Write a function addN which accepts an array and a number. 
The function adds the argument n to each number in the array arr 
and returns a new array.
*/



/*
The function highestAndLowest should accept an array, and return a new array containing 
the highest and lowest numbers from the original array.

/*
Create a function that takes two strings as arguments and returns the number of times 
the first string (a single character) is found in the second string.
ex: matchStr('p', 'apple'); // 2
*/


/*
Write a function that takes in an array of integers. Determine whether the sum of its element in the array is even or odd.

The output should be a string ("odd" or "even").

If the input array is empty, consider it as an array with a zero ([0]).

Examples
evenOrOdd([0]) ➞ "even"
evenOrOdd([1]) ➞ "odd"
evenOrOdd([]) ➞ "even"
evenOrOdd([0, 1, 5]) ➞ "even"
*/



/*
Write a function that takes a number with decimals, and rounds it to the nearest odd number. 
For example, if your number is 3.14, you should round down to 3, if your number is 6.4, 
you should round up to 7.
*/ 


/*
Write a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.
 
Examples
  "hello" ➞ "ehllo"
  "goobye" ➞ "begooy"
  "javascript" ➞ "aacijprstv"

/*
Write a function that takes in an array and returns a new array with duplicates removed
Ex: deleteDups(['a','a','a']) -> ['a']
